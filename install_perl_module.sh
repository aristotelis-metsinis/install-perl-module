#
# Install a "Perl" module into a non-standard directory.
#
# In practice, a standard "perl Makefile.PL" will be done to create the "Makefile", but this 
# time we will make use of non-standard "Perl" installation directory instead of the default one
# through an explicit declaration of all the "target" directories (parameters). 
#
# Script expects two input command line arguments (positional parameters) :
#   $1 : the path to the non-standard "Perl" installation directory (local repository).
#   $2 : the path to the "make-file" of the Perl "module" we're about to install.
#
# PREREQUISITE : "package" should be previously downloaded from the "CPAN" repository [ http://search.cpan.org/ ];
#   for example : $ wget http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/lib/local-lib-1.008004.tar.gz
#   Then we should unpack the "package" ( in our example : $ tar xzf local-lib-1.008004.tar.gz ), and 
#   finally we should change to the newly created directory of the Perl "module" we're about to install; 
#   i.e. the directory that contains the "make-file" ( Makefile.PL ); 
#   in our example : $ cd local-lib-1.008004/.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE : running "perl Makefile.PL" may print out a (long) list of missing "CPAN" module's 
#   "dependencies"; failing to have the required modules (or the right versions thereof) will be fatal. 
#   Unfortunately, this script does not install all those "dependencies" automatically; you should 
#   carefully review "perl Makefile.PL" console output and (pre)install them - if necessary - manually. 
#   Alternatively, you should make use of tools like "CPAN", which installs "Perl" modules with a fairly 
#   simple interface, while it automatically confirms, downloads and installs any "dependencies".
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING : "Perl" searches the directories listed in "@INC", and because "@INC" contains 
#   only the default directories (plus the "." directory), it cannot find an already "locally" 
#   installed "prerequisite" package. In such a case, we should also define/change the "PERL5LIB" 
#   environment variable as follows for example:
#     % export PERL5LIB=<local-repository>/lib/perl5/5.24.0:\
#         <local-repository>/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.24.0:\
#         <local-repository>/lib/perl5/site_perl 
#   "Perl" should automatically prepend the architecture-specific directories to "@INC" if those exist.
#   Finally, we can verify the value of the newly configured "@INC" by executing "perl -V".

# "Silent" module installation: to prevent this "script" from getting into an "interactive" mode during the 
# installation, we should try setting the following environment variable(s) before running it. In practice, 
# we are trying to "simulate" the behaviour of a "CPAN" client.                                                        

# If environment variable "PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT" set to a "true" value then "ExtUtils::MakeMaker's prompt()" function will 
# always return the "default" without waiting for user input. We set this environment variable to a "true" 
# value by default; although its side effect on the installation process is not fully tested.
# Notes: * The following set-up makes "Perl" automatically answer "yes" when "CPAN" asks. 
#        * If "prompt()" detects that it is not running interactively and there is nothing on "STDIN" or if the
# 		   "PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT" environment variable is set to true, the "$default" will be used without prompting. 
# 		   This prevents automated processes from blocking on user input. If no "$default" is provided an empty string 
#		   will be used instead.
#        * We might stick "export PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1" in ".bashrc" (or equivalent for the preferred shell) to stop the 
#		   prompts generally.
export PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1
# In theory the above configuration should be sufficient for a "silent" package installation. If not then the 
# following configurations of the corresponding environment variables could be also examined.

# When "CPAN" runs, it sets the environment variable "PERL5_CPAN_IS_RUNNING" to the "ID" of the running process.
# export PERL5_CPAN_IS_RUNNING=$$

# "CPAN" also sets "PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_RUNNING" to the current process "ID" to prevent runaway processes, which could 
# happen with older versions of "Module::Install".
# export PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_RUNNING=$$

# When running "perl Makefile.PL", the environment variable "PERL5_CPAN_IS_EXECUTING" is set to the full path of the
# "Makefile.PL" that is being executed. This prevents runaway processes with newer versions of "Module::Install".
